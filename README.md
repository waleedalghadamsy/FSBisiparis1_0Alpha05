##Bisipariş System Version 1.0 Alpha 5.

###Business Concept

The purpose of this project is to help anyone to pre-order food from any restaurant; such that the restaurant prepares the ordered food 
**while the customer is on way** to the restaurant. In this way, the waiting period in the restaurant is elminiated and 
the restaurant customer gets his/her food served (almost) immediately upon arrival to the restaurant.

###Software Components

This project includes:
- A backend web application (for system admin and restaurants admins), using ASP.NET Core 3.0 Razor Pages.
- A group of web services, using ASP.NET Core 3.0 Web API.
- A mobile application (targeted to both Android and iPhone), using Xamarin Forms 4.0.

Till now, almost all of the entities (and their properties) have been coded.
About 60% of the functionality (i.e. use cases) of the web backend had been coded.

Coding the mobile app has not started yet. It is will start in this version.
